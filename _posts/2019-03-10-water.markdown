This is my first blog post out to the world. So I am going to make this one simple. I think we are running out of clean water. Even worse, I don't think people have realised it yet. Over the course of next couple of weeks I will try to prove to myself if I am over-reacting or there is merit to this thought. 

Stuff to read on this matter :
